<h2>RDBMS</h2>

<p>Relational database management systems are based on math (specifically set theory). A properly constructed schema&nbsp;ensures the integrity of whatever data it stores. If you want your data to be &quot;bulletproof&quot; then look no further.</p>

<h3>Oracle</h3>

<p>An expensive product although it has had tons of money and decades of research put into it. Basically a name brand product. For historical reasons,&nbsp;Oracle pretends NULL and empty strings are the same thing. Thankfully, Oracle calls this hickup VARCHAR2, which helps avoid issues when working with systems that are more compliant with SQL standards. The company has tried pushing products into other markets but is only a major contender in the RDBMS segment (not that that matters considering their revenue).</p>

<h3>DB2</h3>

<p>An IBM product that lives up to Big Blue&#39;s reputation. Cheaper than Oracle and actually handles NULL strings properly.</p>

<h3>Postgres</h3>

<p>A free product that can go toe-to-toe with DB2/Oracle. Postgres provides great&nbsp;OLTP support with ACID transactions and strives for compliance with SQL standards. Other database vendors may provide more OLAP capabilities although it&#39;s usually more cost effective to just use other software&nbsp;(e.g. NoSQL) rather than pledge your allegiance to a huge company. Also,&nbsp;if you&#39;re denormalizing data you mine as well switch to a NoSQL system.</p>

<h3>SQLite</h3>

<p>A free&nbsp;database engineered to work like Postgres embedded directly into your application. Not recommended&nbsp;for OLTP (you need a client/server database for that) but works well for OLAP.</p>

<h2>NoSQL</h2>

<p>Not all data needs to be &quot;bulletproof&quot; and such level of data integrity comes at a price. RDBMS systems are not&nbsp;good at scaling horizontally because there are so many checks in place to make sure all the data is correct all the time. This is where NoSQL comes in.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<h3>Bash</h3>

<p>The standard for *NIX scripting. Just glue a bunch of commands together and voila!</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p>Compiles on practically any hardware platform. Most operating systems are written in it.</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>The defacto programming language for the web. Most sites use it since it&#39;s practically required. For simple websites jQuery is enough but anything involving more than a few hundred lines of code&nbsp;would be better served using Dojo. It&#39;s like comparing Legos to a 3D printer.</p>

<h3>Lisp</h3>

<p>Expanded the art of AI research decades ago and still influences other languages to this day.</p>

<h3>Lua</h3>

<p>The defacto language for embedding scripts into other languages. It&#39;s like a scripting version of C but with a much easier learning curve (and you can call C code from it too).</p>

<h3>SQL</h3>

<p>The defacto language for processing data.</p>

<h2>Household Name</h2>

<h3>Apple</h3>

<p>Good mobile devices. Otherwise, overpriced namebrand.</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>Their specs usually lack in something.&nbsp;Their Nexus line could be better although decent products all around.</p>

<h3>Microsoft</h3>

<p>Useful for games and certain software that requires Windows.&nbsp;Otherwise not worth the money. Although, Microsoft Research is on another level compared to the rest of the company.</p>

<h3>Samsung</h3>

<p>Basically replaced Nokia as the king of mobile. Their Note line was good up until the 4 and then they screwed up every version&nbsp;after that. Their chips&nbsp;and screens are included in most benchmarks when comparing products. They&#39;ve really&nbsp;solidified their position in multiple&nbsp;markets.</p>

<h2>OS</h2>

<p>An operating system is what most software is coded against (sometimes software is written directly in assembly).</p>

<h3>Arch</h3>

<p>A highly customizable Linux distro with tons of documentation.</p>

<h3>BSD</h3>

<p>A locked down *NIX&nbsp;with plenty of documentation. It&#39;s very organized and well engineered, which affects its compatibility with certain hardware/software. Basically it&#39;s not as good as Linux for desktop applications.&nbsp;Otherwise it&#39;s great for network appliances and secure servers.</p>

<h3>Redhat</h3>

<p>The industry standard for Linux.</p>
